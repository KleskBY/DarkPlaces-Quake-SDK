Textract win32 GUI version
==========================

0) Intro.
This is the win32 GUI version of textract, unfortunately MFC :\.

1) Usage.
Select BSP and WAD file, click "Extract!".

2) Bugs.
If you find any bugs, feel free to report them.

3) Legal stuff.
Textract is free, the source is not available. However, the app is about 25k, I think that's a fair size in case you want to disassemble it =)
