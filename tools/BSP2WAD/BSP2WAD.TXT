Bsp2Wad.exe    by Geoff Phillips   (c) 1997  Version 2
(bug for Erased texture fixed)

This program, written in assembler, lifts all the textures out of a BSP file
as used in Quake, and creates a texture file (.WAD) ready for use
in  Worldcraft or some other editor.

To run, simply type BSP2WAD file.bsp  and instantly (because it's a fast piece
of assembler code, and not any of this high-level "%&!^) you have your wad file.
You can also specify an output filename, so BSP2WAD file.bsp blob.wad.

simple file handling.
