  'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | [Survest Officer] Any word from that assault group that was sent in the Deep Wastes recently? | | [Survest Captain] Not yet sir, They were marked as late last week and at this point L.Gavir wants to write them off as a loss. | | [SRV.OFC] I agree with them in this case, have Imp-Net send the update to them as soon as possible. Speaking of which, how is the activity near Comms Base 5G? | | | [SRV.CPT] Busy, we are routing large chunks of Royal network traffic to assist in the recovery effort. Whatever happened out in the Hab-Blocks occurred all over the planet - rumors of <METAL> rising from abanandoned hangars and something like graves! | | | [SRV.OFC] I still cannot believe the intel myself, and the MILITAR forces seem just as much in the dark as we are.... | | [SRV.CPT] Best not to dwell on ghost stories right now, we`re all missing folks since the initial bombardments. | | [SRV.OFC] You`re right, Captain, we must focus on making those MILITAR pay for their treachery. Stay alert on those comms too, L.Gavir wants us to report any suspicious signals. | <TRANSMISSION LOST>'
  'intel' : 'A large enemy strongpoint dominates the area of operations. | | PSC estimates that the enemy will be able to reinforce any [Listening Post] that is threatened. | | Sensor overflight scans report that each [Listening Post] is also equipped with a small garrison. | | Recommended Strike Package; + 1x Balakett Metal moving at speed to avoid counter-fire.'
