Custom Particle muzzleflashes for DarkPlaces (and other engines (most probably FTE works too)).



Hello Quake addicts,

- Add the 3 QC files into your Quake-QC-1.06 devkit and compile them.
- add the 4 effects into your ID1 "effectinfo.txt" to have BASIC particle muzzleflashes for both shotguns and nailguns



ATTENTION: This is just a demonstration of the possibilities of particle muzzleflashes. 
	   You can make much more beautiful ones with sparks and all.   I dont have the time... 
	   Particle muzzleflashes are sensitive to player movement (because they are not stuck to the weapon)
	   The muzzleflashes are weapon model independent.


Have fun creating your own beautiful effects.


Kind regards,
Seven.
